# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most severe type
of brain disorder found mainly in people 60 years of age or
over.The latest developments on Multimodal Neuroimaging(MN)
data have allowed the identification of the disease in life that
was a breakthrough in neurosciences. Early diagnosis of AD is
essential for the progress of more prevailing treatments.Recently,
substantial focus has been paid to applying Deep Learning(DL)
to early identification and automatic diagnosis of AD as rapid
progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale
MN data.

To save the overall time and energy of the doctors and
increase their effectiveness in saving the lives of the sufferers,
we suggest a classification of the AD using deep neural networks
such as CNN,ANN and MLP.This research is aimed to provide
an overview and critical assessment for the early identification of
the AD to help the physicians in providing appropriate treatment
to the patients based on the four different classes which we have
considered in our dataset.

We found out that CNN was the most optimum neural network for this classiﬁcation task as it outperformed other neural networks by a vast margin, with a test accuracy of 0.91. To add to that, we also discovered that ANN and MLP performed quite similarly and gave us an accuracy score of around 0.77 and 0.75
